# The `build2` packaging

The aim of this organization is to serve as a convenient collaboration place
for packaging third-party projects for `build2`.

By publishing your efforts under this organization (as opposed to, say, your
personal projects) you make it easier for others to join or, if you are no
longer interested, to take over the package development/maintenance.

In addition to this organization we also have the
[`packaging@build2.org`](https://lists.build2.org) mailing list and the
[`#build2`](https://cpplang.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=build2) channel
on [`cpplang.slack.com`](https://cpplang.slack.com/). To join, simply get
in touch using either medium.
